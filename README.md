## Description
This project was developed based on a prototype created in **Figma**, which served as the foundation for the user interface and experience. The prototype was designed to ensure intuitive navigation and an appealing layout, facilitating the implementation of functionalities and styles in Angular. The goal was to transform the design vision into a functional application while maintaining the aesthetics and usability defined in the prototype.
